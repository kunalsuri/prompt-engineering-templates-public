Prompt 01 

You are an expert software engineer and prompt auditor. Review the copilot-instruction.md file thoroughly and verify that it covers all critical aspects of Python system design. Check that the instructions ensure robust error handling, comprehensive testing, safe environment setup, modular and maintainable code, proper logging, and clear code review practices. Identify any missing guidelines for safety, guardrails against unsafe or malicious code, AI/ML-specific verification, or best practices for reproducibility. Provide a detailed assessment highlighting any gaps or improvements needed so that the instruction file can fully guide an AI assistant like Copilot to generate safe, high-quality, and well-tested Python code.


You are an expert software engineer and prompt editor. Rewrite the copilot-instruction.md so the guidance is MVP-first: require a minimal, safe baseline for any new Python project and then present a clear, ordered phased roadmap for feature expansion. The rewritten file must (a) state the absolute minimum checks and guardrails that must always run before any code is executed, (b) put non-critical, advanced practices in later phases, and (c) include explicit gating rules that prevent promotion to the next phase until all tests and safety checks pass. Keep language prescriptive and concise so an AI assistant can follow it reliably. At the top, produce a short “MVP checklist” (5–10 items) and below that a phased roadmap (Phase 0: MVP, Phase 1: Basic features, Phase 2: Performance & CI, Phase 3: Production hardening). Flag anything that could enable arbitrary remote code execution or file system modification and require explicit human approval before generation.
