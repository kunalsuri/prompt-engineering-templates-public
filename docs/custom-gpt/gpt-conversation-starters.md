- Prompt Auditor: Take the role of an advanced LLM-Coding Judge and Prompt Engineer. Audit and evaluate this prompt. Check correctness, clarity, feasibility, and whether it will function reliably in a coding agent. Keep the feedback concise and focused on issues and improvements only. OK?
- Think as a Prompt Engineer and rewrite this prompt that I'm giving you. OK? The prompt is as follows ->


# Cinema / Film Making

## Transformer

- Rewrite: I’m uploading a script. Analyze it and then rewrite it with the following changes while keeping everything coherent.
- Transform the Protagonist: Here is a story I wrote. I want you to transform the protagonist, update all references, and regenerate the full scene.
- Tone Shift Options: Here’s an excerpt. Give me three possible rewrites using different tones (e.g., warm, dark, comedic), then produce the best full version.
- Adaptive Character Rework: I’m giving you a section of my script. Provide three alternative ways to modify the protagonist while keeping the plot coherent.

## Genesis 

- The Pitch to Outline: I'm pitching a Neon Noir Thriller about an aging detective who realizes the victim in his last case is his younger self. Give me the logline, premise, and a three-act breakdown.
- The Scene Generator: Write a three-page Screenplay scene (INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT) where a silent, tense negotiation over a briefcase goes wrong. I want the Cinematic Notes for this scene to suggest low-key lighting and wide-angle shots.
- The Script Doctor / Beat Refinement: I have a story where the midpoint is a massive explosion, but it feels too sudden. How can I restructure the beats leading up to it to better escalate the stakes and build tension for the main character?
- The Simple Idea Starter: A pizza delivery driver who accidentally delivers a secret encrypted flash drive to the wrong address. Develop a full outline for a 5-minute crime-comedy short film based on this, including the logline and key beats

# Cinematography Terms

## Camera Shots (Framing)
* Wide Shot (WS) ? Shows full environment and subject.
* Long Shot (LS) ? Full body; strong spatial context.
* Medium Shot (MS) ? Waist-up; balanced emotion + context.
* Medium Close-Up (MCU) ? Chest-up; stronger intimacy.
* Close-Up (CU) ? Face fills frame; high emotional detail.
* Extreme Close-Up (ECU) ? Isolates a detail (eyes, hands).
* Two-Shot ? Two characters in one frame.
* Over-the-Shoulder (OTS) ? From behind a character toward another.
* Point-of-View (POV) ? As seen by the character.
* Insert Shot ? Close detail of an object.
  
## Camera Angles
* Eye-Level Angle ? Neutral, natural perspective.
* High Angle ? Camera above subject; conveys weakness or scale.
* Low Angle ? Camera below subject; power or dominance.
* Dutch Angle (Tilted) ? Tilted horizon; tension or unease.
* Bird?s-Eye View (Top-Down) ? Directly above; geometric look.
* Worm?s-Eye View ? Very low; dramatic perspective.
  
## Camera Movement
* Pan ? Horizontal rotation from fixed point.
* Tilt ? Vertical rotation from fixed point.
* Dolly ? Camera moves physically forward/backward.
* Truck/Track ? Camera moves sideways.
* Crane/Jib ? Vertical or sweeping motion on a crane.
* Steadicam ? Stabilized moving shot with human operator.
* Handheld ? Organic, shaky feel.
* Push-In ? Slow move closer; rising tension/emotion.
* Pull-Out ? Slow move back; reveals context.
* Rack Focus ? Shift focus between subjects in one shot.
* Zoom ? Lens-based magnification (not physical movement).
  
## Composition Principles
* Rule of Thirds ? Key subjects placed on thirds.
* Leading Lines ? Environment lines guide viewer attention.
* Depth ? Foreground, midground, background layering.
* Headroom ? Space above character?s head.
* Lead Room ? Space in direction of gaze/movement.
* Framing ? Using architecture/nature to frame subjects.
* Negative Space ? Empty areas to emphasize mood or scale.
* Symmetry ? Centered, balanced compositions.
  
Lighting Terms

* Natural Light ? Sunlight or ambient natural sources.
* Motivated Lighting ? Light justified by a scene element.
* Color Temperature ? Warm (3200K) vs cold (5600K).
  
## Lens & Optics

* Depth of Field ? Range in focus.
* Bokeh ? Quality of out-of-focus areas.
* Aperture (f-stop) ? Controls light + depth of field.
* Shutter Speed ? Controls motion blur.
* ISO ? Sensor sensitivity.
  
## Film Language / Editing Concepts

# Gold Standard Example Outputs

## Example (Format 2.1: Cinematic Paragraph) | Cinematic Paragraph Prompt for Scene: The Archive

A slow dolly push-in on a 50mm lens at eye-level, starting MCU and moving closer to Clara, a 30s historian with a dark bob and navy-blue coat. She stands at a large wooden table in a grand, dimly-lit Parisian archive with dust motes in the air. The lighting is low-key, a single soft beam from a high window illuminates the book and Clara against deep shadows. With intense concentration, she uses a gloved hand to carefully turn the yellowed page of a massive book. The mood is quiet, studious, and suspenseful. The palette is warm browns and deep blues. Clara says: "It has to be here." No subtitles, no distortions, no flickering, no extra characters, no warping, no stretched limbs, no glitching, No celebrity likeness, no logos.

## Example (Format 2.2: Timestamp Workflow)

Timestamp Prompt for Scene: The Jungle Ruin Medium shot from behind a young female explorer with a leather satchel and messy brown hair in a ponytail, as she pushes aside a large jungle vine to reveal a hidden path. Reverse shot of the explorer's freckled face, her expression filled with awe as she gazes upon ancient, moss-covered ruins in the background. SFX: The rustle of dense leaves, distant exotic bird calls. Tracking shot following the explorer as she steps into the clearing and runs her hand over the intricate carvings on a crumbling stone wall. Emotion: Wonder and reverence. Wide, high-angle crane shot, revealing the lone explorer standing small in the center of the vast, forgotten temple complex, half-swallowed by the jungle. SFX: A swelling, gentle orchestral score begins to play.
