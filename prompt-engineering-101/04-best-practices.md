# Best Practices in Prompt Engineering

## General Guidelines
- Start with a clear goal in mind
- Be specific about the desired output format
- Use delimiters for complex inputs
- Test with different models and settings

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Vague or ambiguous instructions
- Overly complex prompts
- Assuming model knowledge
- Not testing with edge cases

## Advanced Techniques
- Temperature and top-p adjustments
- System vs. user messages in chat models
- Prompt chaining for complex tasks
- Using external tools and APIs in conjunction with prompts
