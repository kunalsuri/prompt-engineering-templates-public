# Template example for VEO 3 / 3.1

Take this short idea: [INSERT YOUR SHORT BRIEF HERE] 

Expand it into a full Veo 3 prompt using this structure: 
1. Scene Summary – Rewrite my brief as a cinematic moment in one clear sentence. 
2. Subject – Describe the main subject(s) in rich detail (appearance, clothing, physical features). 
3. Background & Context – Expand the setting/environment for my idea. 
4. Action – Describe what’s happening, based on my brief, with realistic movement. 
5. Style & Aesthetic – Always cinematic, photorealistic, professional film look, high detail. 
6. Camera Instructions – Add shot type (close-up, wide shot, POV, aerial, etc.), movement (dolly, pan, tracking), and angle (eye-level, low/high). 
7. Composition & Framing – Professional framing that emphasizes the subject clearly. 
8. Lighting & Mood – Realistic cinematic lighting to match the mood (golden hour, moody, neon, etc.). 
9. Audio – Add dialogue/ambient sounds/effects that fit the scene. Always add (no subtitles). 
10. Color Palette – Cohesive cinematic tones that enhance mood. 
11. Negative Instructions – Avoid subtitles, distortions, unrealistic proportions, flickering, or extra characters not in the brief. 
Expand it into a full Veo 3 prompt, but write it as one continuous cinematic paragraph (not bullet points, no section labels).
