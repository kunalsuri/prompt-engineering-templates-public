# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Welcome to the world of Prompt Engineering! This guide will help you master the art of crafting effective prompts for large language models.

## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models to achieve desired outputs.

## Why is it Important?
- Improves model performance and reliability
- Reduces ambiguity in model responses
- Enables more precise control over AI behavior
- Saves time and resources
