# Core Principles of Prompt Engineering

## 1. Clarity is Key
- Be specific and unambiguous in your instructions
- Use clear and concise language
- Define any specialized terms or concepts

## 2. Context Matters
- Provide sufficient context for the task
- Include relevant examples when possible
- Specify the desired format or structure

## 3. Iterative Refinement
- Start with a simple prompt and refine based on outputs
- Test different phrasings and structures
- Document what works and what doesn't

## 4. Balance Specificity and Flexibility
- Be specific enough to get useful results
- But allow the model some creative freedom when appropriate
- Use constraints to guide rather than restrict
