- Ensure API services return clear error messages and typed responses.  
- Identify missing or weak error handling cases.  

### ðŸ“¦ Output
- Annotated code improvements (error boundaries, try/catch, fallbacks).  
- File-by-file audit report.  
- Best practice recommendations for consistent error handling.
