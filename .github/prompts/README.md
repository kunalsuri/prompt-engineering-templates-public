# ðŸ—‚ Prompt Manifest

This folder contains reusable **prompt templates** for guiding AI coding agents (e.g., Copilot, GPT) when working on this React + TypeScript SaaS project.  
Each file defines a **mode** with clear rules and expected outputs.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Quality & Audits
- **`audit.md`** â†’ Audit the codebase for compliance with React + TypeScript best practices and Feature-Driven Development (FDD). Produces per-file and overall summary.
- **`accessibility-audit.md`** â†’ Check JSX/HTML for accessibility issues. Reports violations, ARIA usage, keyboard navigation, and fixes.
- **`performance-audit.md`** â†’ Analyze bundle, rendering, and component structure. Suggests memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting optimizations.

---

## ðŸ›  Build & Improve
- **`feature-generator.md`** â†’ Generate new feature modules. Includes components, hooks, services, and integration steps.
- **`refactor.md`** â†’ Clean and optimize legacy code. Ensures modularity, removes duplication, and aligns with workspace rules.
- **`migration.md`** â†’ Assist with dependency or framework upgrades (e.g., React, TypeScript, Tailwind). Provides migration plan and code updates.
- **`error-handling.md`** â†’ Audit and add proper error handling. Suggests `try/catch`, error boundaries, fallback UI, and logging.

---

## âœ… Testing
- **`testing.md`** â†’ Generate Jest + React Testing Library unit and integration tests. Provides coverage checklist.

---

## ðŸ“– Documentation
- **`readme-update.md`** â†’ Scan codebase and update root `README.md` with project description, setup, usage, and feature list.
- **`docs-generator.md`** â†’ Generate structured documentation under `/docs`:
  - `architecture.md` â†’ Project architecture & module structure  
  - `components.md` â†’ Core React components & props  
  - `hooks.md` â†’ Custom hooks with usage examples  
  - `api.md` â†’ API endpoints and contracts  
  - `conventions.md` â†’ Coding style, naming, TypeScript rules  
  - `changelog.md` â†’ Project changes and history
- **`release-notes.md`** â†’ Auto-generate release notes based on commits and code changes.

---

## ðŸ“š Knowledge
- **`knowledge-extractor.md`** â†’ Convert comments, scattered practices, and implicit patterns into consolidated developer guides.

---

## ðŸ”– Usage
- Run any prompt file as a **workspace instruction** for your coding agent.  
- Each prompt is written in Markdown with YAML front matter (`mode`, `description`).  
- Use them as-is or extend them with feature/task-specific details.  

---

ðŸš€ With these prompts, you can:  
- **Audit â†’ Improve â†’ Build â†’ Document â†’ Release**  
in a repeatable, agent-friendly workflow.
